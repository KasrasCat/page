[A Hodge Theory for Entanglement Cohomology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12529)

 # Current Research
 
 Currently, I am working with Christian Ferko to describe entanglement in terms of generative effects as described by [Adams](https://elieadam.com/eadam_PhDThesis.pdf). This includes a variety of routes including but not limited to Von-Neumann algebras, Segre Embedding, Entanglement cohomology, and the descent condition in geometry.
 I presented on the topic at the Math Union Undergraduate Colloquim at U of T.
 
 # Past Personal Research
 
I did some personal work on quillen adjunctions and homotopy equivalence of categories.
